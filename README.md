E2E Encrypted SMS


This was a masters project to build an E2E encrypted SMS app for android. 
Almost everything needs to be rewritten and updated to keep with the times, 
it was more of a short proof of concept to show that it is relatively simple.

We still need to finish writing the part that pulls the messages from the sms db
and polls for new incoming messages. Also need to write the key sharing subsystems.
